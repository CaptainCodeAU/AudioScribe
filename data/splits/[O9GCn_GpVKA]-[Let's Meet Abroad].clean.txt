It's 3:30, and we have a flight to catch for Lukla in a couple of hours. These are our backpacks, and we’ll let you know in 16 days if everything we packed was worth it or if we forgot something. So, let's start the video. Welcome to Let's Meet Abroad; we are Adi and Mira. This year, we finally decided to tackle one of our bucket list hikes: the Everest Base Camp Trek in Nepal. We chose to do this trek without a guide or porter. Are you planning to do this trek or any other multi-day trekking? Keep watching, as we’ll share our ultimate packing list to help you prepare for this beautiful but tough trek.

First, let's talk about the most important item for trekking solo: the main backpack. We both have Gregory backpacks and have really fallen in love with this brand. After trying many backpacks, I put on the Gregory and thought, “Wow, this is the one.” Adi had the same experience. The quality of the shoulder and waist straps is so good that it makes your life much easier. Gregory, if you want to sponsor us, we’re open to it!

Next, we need to discuss shoes. Everyone on the trek had proper hiking shoes that go over the ankle. Many people say sneakers are fine, but they’re not suitable for higher altitudes where it gets cold, and if you accidentally get your feet wet, you need proper hiking shoes that are weather-resistant and somewhat waterproof. Besides the main hiking shoes, we also took shoes for the evening because you don’t want to walk all day in your hiking shoes. I brought down shoes that are super light, foldable, warm, and cozy. They were really cheap, about 12 euros. Adi has North Face ones for around 40 euros, but I recommend just taking the cheaper ones since you’ll want to throw them away after the hike. I used normal slippers, and I survived without frostbite, but my feet would freeze in slippers. You need something warm for your feet.

Now, let’s talk about clothing. We did extensive research before the trek on what to take and what materials to use, and we were really happy with our choices. For tops, I took three Merino t-shirts from Decathlon. Merino wool is great because it doesn’t stink even after sweating. I had three Merino t-shirts, two half-sleeve, and one long-sleeve. I could have managed with two, so three was a bit excessive. For base layers, I took three full Merino wool base layers. When it got really cold at higher altitudes, I wore a base layer, a t-shirt, and my down jacket at around minus five to minus six degrees, especially above Dingboche on the way to Gorakh Shep. In the evenings at the tea houses, I wore my fresh Merino wool base layer with my fleece. Again, three base layers were more than enough; two would suffice.

Adi also packed pants because it got pretty cold. He had one normal hiking pant from Columbia that can zip off to become shorts, and he wore that throughout the trek. For evenings, he had a pajama set, which took up a lot of space. If you have something warm that doesn’t take up much space, that’s better. He also took leggings for the cold mornings, wearing them under the Columbia pants. He had gym shorts as well, which are good for extra warmth.

I packed seven pairs of underwear because I worried about potential issues, but I think four would be enough for guys. For socks, we both took Merino socks, which were a game changer. I had three pairs: one for the evening and two for hiking. I took four Merino t-shirts, two long-sleeve Merino shirts, one long-sleeve night set, a pair of leggings, and a lightweight trekking pant. I also had a fleece, which is more than enough since you usually don’t wear it while hiking. I took five pairs of socks, but I think I could have managed with fewer.

A lightweight down jacket is essential—it’s a great investment. Adi’s down jacket is also a rain jacket, while mine is only drizzle-proof. I also brought a poncho, which I ended up carrying without using since it didn’t rain. Don’t forget gloves; you need good ones that block the wind. A buff is also essential for keeping warm. I had a Merino wool buff that didn’t allow for easy breathing, so I recommend getting one from the brand Buff.

We also had winter caps. Now, let’s move on to sleeping bags. After much research, we got the Sea to Summit Trek TK sleeping bags, which weigh just under one kilo. It’s essential to have a sleeping bag that’s lightweight but still warm. We also used a Thermolite liner to keep our sleeping bags clean and add warmth.

For toiletries, I packed a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a bar of soap. Sunscreen is crucial; we saw people who got badly burned. I had a separate sunscreen for my face and body. Lip sunscreen and Vaseline are also important because everything gets really dry. 

Regarding medicines, I packed a lot since I got food poisoning. It’s good to have a variety of medicines, including painkillers, diarrhea pills, and oral rehydration salts (ORS). You can buy some medicines in Namche, but it’s wise to bring what you know you’ll need. Baby wipes are a lifesaver when it gets too cold to shower.

We also recommend bringing a headlamp for times when the electricity goes out. It’s really handy. Since there’s a lot of downtime during the trek, having something to do is important. I took my e-reader, and many others brought cards or games. It’s best not to use your phone too much to save battery life.

Hiking sticks are essential; they save your knees and are beneficial for your health. A quick-dry towel is also useful for occasional showers, and don’t forget toilet paper. As for food, we brought a few trek bars and bought snacks along the way. There’s plenty of good food available on the trek, so you don’t need to overpack snacks.

I got a Nalgene water bottle, which I found very useful. Looking back, I regret not bringing bouillon and teabags. Bouillon would have been comforting when I was sick, and teabags would have allowed me to enjoy more tea without having to buy it. A small Ziploc bag with vitamins would also be beneficial, as fresh fruits and veggies are scarce on the trek.

In total, our backpacks, without camera gear, weighed around 8 to 10 kilos. With camera gear, mine was about 15 kilos, and Mira's was around 13.5 kilos. A Peak Design clip for my camera was a game changer; it allows you to attach your camera securely to your backpack without the hassle of a strap.
